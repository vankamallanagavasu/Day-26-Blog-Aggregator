It's mentioned in Greek, Hebrew, Buddhist and Christian mythology and writings. It's described in records dating from around 1500 BCE as a treatment for tapeworm and other parasites. Pomegranate is one of the "seven kinds" of fruit mentioned in the Bible which Israel was blessed with long ago. </p>
