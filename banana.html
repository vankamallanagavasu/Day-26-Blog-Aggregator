                            <p class="excerpt">A banana is the common name for a type of fruit and also the name for the herbaceous plants that grow it. These plants belong to the genus Musa. They are native to the tropical region of southeast Asia.

                                Historians think the first people to grow bananas for food lived in Papua New Guinea.[1] Today, they are cultivated in tropical regions around the world.[2] Most banana plants are grown for their fruits, which botanically are a type of berry. Some are grown as ornamental plants, or for their fibres.</p>

                            <p class="excerpt">Red bananas are a group of varieties of bananas with reddish-purple skin. Some are smaller and plumper than the common Cavendish banana, others much larger. When ripe, raw red bananas have a flesh that is creamy to light pink. They are also softer and sweeter than the yellow Cavendish varieties, some with a slight tangy raspberry flavor and others with an earthy one. Many red bananas are exported by producers in East Africa, Asia, South America, and the United Arab Emirates. They are a favorite in Central America[1][2] as a form of aphrodisiac juice, along with being a favourite in India to promote fertility but are sold throughout the world.</p>
